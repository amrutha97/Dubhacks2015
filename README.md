Our project for DubHacks 2015.

We used the Instagram and Clarifai APIs to detect similarities between two users' Instagram profiles. The result is printed as a % similarity.

This application has many real-world applications. It could be used by artists/photographers to track down accounts that repost their copyrighted photos or by college students to compare their profiles to their friends.

Help us by messing around with the algorithm and trying to normalize it!
